# PyIFT

## Python Image Foresting Transform Library

PyIFT is a Python wrapper of a fork the [LIDS](http://lids.ic.unicamp.br/) C library.

Its main feature is fast shortest-path algorithms in image grids and sparse graphs to perform the image foresting transform operators.

## Installation

Install PyIFT via pip.

```sh
pip install pyift
```

## Acknowledgements

The development of this library was initially supported by FAPESP (2018/08951-8 and 2016/21591-5).
